1. Write a script that opens the in.html file, finds a link of type <a
href = "..."> and writes the found addresses to the out.html file as a table.

in.html:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="ek">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Посилання</title>
</head>
<body>
<a href = "http://pnu.edu.ua">Прикарпатський національний університет імені Василя
Стефаника</a>
</body>
</html>

out.html:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="uk">
<head>
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<title>Назви</title>
</head>
<body>
<table border="1">
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>http://pnu.edu.ua</td>
</tr>
</table>
</body>
</html>

3. Find all occurrences of the date in the text file, consisting of the name of the month and
numbers, and change the month to January. For example: December 23 was cold -> January 23 was
coldly.

4. Find C-style multi-line comments in the file that contain the date in DD format.
MM-YYYY or DD-MM. This is possible when the month is given in words, but not

figures (for example, October 12, 2019). Print the dates.
5. Find in the text a combination of the words "white" or "black", "dog" or "cat". Count
the number of occurrences of each of the options separately.
6. Write a regular expression to validate the first and last name, where each word should
start with a capital letter, a space between words, words can only contain letters. Not
Latin and Cyrillic letters can be mixed.
